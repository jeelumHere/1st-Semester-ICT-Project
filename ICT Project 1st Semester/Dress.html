                    <p>Traditional Punjabi attire is characterized by vibrant colors and the iconic Salwar Kameez, often
                        styled as a pleated Patiala suit for women. This is usually paired with a stunning Phulkari
                        dupatta, while men wear a Kurta Pajama topped with a symbolic Turban. The ensemble is
                        traditionally finished with handcrafted leather Juttis worn by both genders. These outfits

                        its elegantly pleated, voluminous lower garment paired with a short kurti. This outfit is
                        traditionally completed with a colorful Phulkari dupatta, a shawl featuring intricate,
                        hand-stitched floral embroidery that symbolizes prosperity. These garments, often finished with

                        Juttis, reflecting a style that is both practical and dignified.</p>

                    <p>Traditional Sindhi men primarily wear a Kurta (tunic) over wide trousers called Sindhi Shalwar or
                        Suthan. Their ensemble is defined by two key accessories: the distinctive block-printed Ajrak
                        shawl draped over the shoulders and the round, embroidered Sindhi Cap (Topi). These comfortable
                        and symbolic garments reflect the region's strong cultural identity and rich heritage. The Ajrak
                        itself is highly versatile and is used ceremonially, often tied as a turban or presented as a
                        token of honor. The attire is traditionally finished with simple, comfortable leather slip-on
                        shoes or sandals.</p>

                    <p>Balochi attire is known for its modesty and cultural pride. Women wear a loose dress (pashk)
                        heavily adorned with intricate, colorful hand-embroidery (doch), often including a large pocket,
                        which can indicate tribal origin. Men wear a loose shalwar kameez with a voluminous turban

                    <p>Pakhtoon (Pashtun) attire is rooted in the loose-fitting shalwar kameez, prioritizing modesty,
                        dignity, and practicality for the mountainous climate. For men, the outfit is the Perahan wa
                        Tunban (tunic and baggy trousers), often paired with a waistcoat (waskat) for layering. The
                        essential cultural marker is the distinctive headwear, such as the large turban (patkay or
                        lungi) or the rolled woolen cap (Pakol). Women traditionally wear the firaq partug (a long,
                        full-skirted dress over trousers) which is famously decorated with vibrant beads and complex
                        embroidery across the bodice and shoulders, particularly for special occasions. Ultimately, all
                        traditional Pashtun clothing utilizes loose cuts and durable fabrics to facilitate movement and
                        protect the wearer in the harsh terrain.</p>

                    <p>The traditional Pakhtoon (Pashtun) women's attire is the firaq partug, a three-piece ensemble of
                        a long, full-skirted dress (firaq) over loose trousers (partug), completed with a headscarf
                        (chador). Crucially, the firaq is characterized by its vibrant, heavy embroidery and
                        beading—especially on the shoulders—which showcases the wearer's craftsmanship and cultural
                        identity. For formal wear, rich fabrics like silk or velvet in deep colors are used, making the
                        outfit a beautiful statement of Pashtun heritage.</p>

                    <p>The traditional dress for Pakhtoon men is the Perahan wa Tunban, consisting of an extra-long,
                        loose tunic and extremely baggy trousers, essential for comfort and movement in the rough
                        terrain. This foundational outfit is almost always complemented by a waistcoat and the highly
                        significant headwear: either a large, expertly-wrapped turban (Patkay or Lungi) or the
                        soft,woolen Pakol cap. These elements combine to create a look that embodies
                        practicality,modesty,and deep cultural honor.</p>

                    <p>Gilgiti attire is defined by its adaptation to the cold, featuring heavy woolen robes (Chugha)
                        over a shalwar kameez. The essential men's accessory is the soft, rolled-rim Gilgiti cap (Khoi),
                        often adorned with a feather for dignity. Women wear loose dresses and a distinctive,
                        embroidered cap (Iraghi) with traditional silver jewelry.</p>

                    <p>Gilgiti women wear a loose, long tunic (pashan) over shalwar, often crafted from durable,
                        colorful fabrics. The most recognizable component is the distinctive embroidered cap (Iraghi or
                        Nating). Formal dresses feature rich embroidery and beadwork on the bodice and sleeves. The look
                        is finalized with traditional silver jewelry adorning the cap and clothing, reflecting their
                        unique mountain culture.</p>

                        woolen cloak known as the Chugha or Shuqa, essential for protection from the harsh cold. The
                        defining cultural marker is the soft, white woolen Gilgiti cap (Khoi or Phartsun) with a rolled
                        rim. This cap is often adorned with a feather or plume for formal occasions, symbolizing the
                        wearer's honor and dignity. The attire as a whole is a highly practical and proud expression of
                        their high-altitude heritage.</p>

                    <p>Traditional Kashmiri dress centers on the Pheran (or Phiran), a long, loose, gown-like robe worn
                        by both men and women, designed primarily to provide warmth against the cold climate. Women's
                        Pherans are highly decorative, showcasing exquisite embroidery like Tilla (metallic thread) or
                        Sozni (fine needlepoint) work. Men's Pherans are simpler, focused on utility. Both styles are
                        often paired with a Pashmina shawl and distinctive traditional headwear, making the attire a
                        practical yet elegant expression of Kashmiri culture.</p>

                        garment is combined with unique traditional headwear, like the Kasaba (padded cap) or the
                        Taranga (trailing headscarf). The attire is often finalized with a luxurious Pashmina shawl,
                        creating a highly elegant and culturally expressive look.</p>

                    <p>Kashmiri men's traditional attire is the Pheran (Phiran), a long, loose, gown-like robe typically
                        made of thick wool or tweed for protection during the harsh winter. Unlike the women's version,
                        the men's Pheran is generally plain and unembellished, emphasizing utility, warmth, and
                        simplicity. This garment allows for the carrying of a Kangri (fire pot) underneath for personal
                        heating. The outfit is often completed with a waistcoat and traditional headwear, such as the
                        Karakul fur cap or a simple skullcap.</p>
